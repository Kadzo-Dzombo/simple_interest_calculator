## Our Pledge

We as contributors and maintainers pledge to make participation in this project a respectful and harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity or expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We commit to fostering an open and welcoming environment where all participants feel safe to share ideas, ask questions, and contribute.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contribute to a positive environment include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback

* Focusing on what is best for the community

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* Harassment, discrimination, or hateful language
* Personal attacks, insults, or derogatory comments
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others’ private information without permission
* Any conduct that could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing acceptable standards of behavior. Maintainers may take appropriate action in response to behavior they deem inappropriate, including warning the offender, removing content, or restricting participation.

Maintainers will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate and are expected to apply rules fairly and consistently.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces, including repositories, issue trackers, pull requests, discussions, and any official communication channels.

It also applies when an individual is representing the project in public spaces, such as conferences, social media, or community events.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Project maintainers may use the following general guidelines when determining consequences:

1. **Correction** – A private or public warning explaining why the behavior was inappropriate.
2. **Warning** – A formal notice that continued behavior may result in further action.
3. **Temporary Ban** – Temporary suspension from participation in project spaces.
4. **Permanent Ban** – Permanent removal from the project community.

Reports of unacceptable behavior can be submitted to the project maintainers. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is inspired by common open-source community standards and adapted for this project’s needs. It may be modified and updated as the project evolves.
